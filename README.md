Understanding the Concept

Metric Measure Spaces: The GW distance compares two metric measure spaces, (X₁, d₁, μ₁) and (X₂, d₂, μ₂), where d is a distance function and μ is a probability measure on the space. 

Core Idea: The GW distance is the minimum cost of matching points from the two spaces such that the internal structure (distances) of the spaces is preserved as much as possible. 

Formal Definition: For the GW distance of order 2 (GW²), it's defined as the infimum over all measure couplings (γ) of the integral of |d₁(x, x') - d₂(y, y')|².
